intro: Observability is a measure of how well the internal states of a system can be inferred from the knowledge of its external outputs.
---

It consists of the three major pillars below.

- **Metrics:** numeric values that are collected and aggregated over a period of time.
- **Tracing:** the activities that occur when a request/transaction occurs in the system from the point of entry to exit.
- **Logging:** text records of activities that occurred with relevant information along with the timestamp.

## Provide observability in Ballerina

Metrics, distributed tracing, and logging are key methods that reveal the internal state of the system to provide observability. Ballerina becomes fully observable by exposing itself via these three methods to various external systems allowing metrics such as request count and response time statistics to be monitored, perform distributed tracing, and analyze logs.

Ballerina services and any client connectors are observable by default. HTTP/HTTPS and SQL client
connectors use semantic tags to make tracing and metrics monitoring more informative.

This guide focuses on enabling Ballerina service observability with some of its supported systems.

<a href="https://prometheus.io/" target="_blank">Prometheus</a> and <a href="https://grafana.com/" target="_blank">Grafana</a> are used for metrics monitoring, and <a href="https://www.jaegertracing.io/" target="_blank">Jaeger</a> is used for distributed tracing. 

Ballerina logs can be fed to any external log monitoring system like the 
<a href="https://www.elastic.co/" target="_blank">Elastic</a> to perform log monitoring and analysis.

## Observe a Ballerina service

Follow the steps below to observe a sample Ballerina service.

### Step 1 - create a `Hello World` Ballerina service
 
Create a new Ballerina project using the `bal new` command.
```
$ bal new observability_demo

Created new package 'observability_demo' at observability_demo.
```
Delete everything inside the `main.bal` file which is located inside the newly created `observability_demo` directory, and replace it with the following code to create a Ballerina service.

```ballerina
import ballerina/http;
import ballerina/log;
import ballerinax/jaeger as _;
import ballerinax/prometheus as _;

service /hello on new http:Listener(9090) {

    isolated resource function get sayHello() returns string {
        log:printInfo("This is a test Info log");
        log:printError("This is a test Error log");
        return "Hello, World!";
    }

}
```

### Step 2 - observe the `Hello World` Ballerina service

Observability can be added to a Ballerina project by adding the following section to the `Ballerina.toml` file. 
```toml
[build-options]
observabilityIncluded=true
```

>**Note:** the above configuration is included by default in the `Ballerina.toml` file generated when initiating a new 
package using the `bal new` command.

Alternatively, we can pass the `--observability-included` flag with the `bal run` command to start a Ballerina program with observability enabled.

To include the Prometheus and Jaeger extensions into the executable, the
`ballerinax/prometheus` and `ballerinax/jaeger` modules need to be imported into your Ballerina code.

```ballerina
import ballerinax/prometheus as _;
import ballerinax/jaeger as _;
```

Observability is disabled by default at runtime. It can be enabled selectively for metrics and tracing by adding
the following runtime configurations to the `Config.toml` file. Create the file inside the `observability_demo` directory and add the following section.

```toml
[ballerina.observe]
metricsEnabled=true
metricsReporter="prometheus"
tracingEnabled=true
tracingProvider="jaeger"
```

Run the Ballerina service. 

```
$ bal run

Compiling source

Running executable

ballerina: started Prometheus HTTP listener 0.0.0.0:9797
ballerina: started publishing traces to Jaeger on localhost:55680
```

When Ballerina observability is enabled, the Ballerina runtime exposes internal metrics via an HTTP endpoint (`/metrics`) for
metrics monitoring and traces will be published to Jaeger. Prometheus should be configured to scrape metrics from
the metrics HTTP endpoint in Ballerina.

Ballerina logs are logged on the console. Therefore, the logs need to be redirected to a file, which can then be
pushed to [Elastic](#distributed-logging) to perform the log analysis.

Therefore, redirect the standard output to a file if you want to monitor logs.

```
$ bal run &> ballerina.log
```

### Step 3 - send requests
 
Send requests to <http://localhost:9090/hello/sayHello>.

Example cURL command:

```
$ curl http://localhost:9090/hello/sayHello
```

### Step 4 - observe metrics, traces & logs

A ballerina service can be observed as follows. 

1. [Observe metrics using Prometheus](/learn/observe-metrics)

2. [Observe tracing using Jaeger](/learn/observe-tracing)

3. [Observe logs with Elastic Stack](/learn/observe-logs)
